[31m-[m
[31m-Multi-robot autonomous navigation is challenging in unstructured environments due to multiple reasons - agents may be non-cooperative, the environment may consist of unpredictable humans, environments may be constrained or consist of unknown objects or terrains. Research is spread across various domains such as perception, prediction, modeling, simulation, and planning in order to make multi-robot planning in such environments safer, efficient, and socially-compliant in the presence of humans. One of the main goals of this workshop is to bring together research communities working at the intersection of multi-agent systems, social robot navigation, and human behavior modeling. Through invited talks, panel discussions, and paper presentations, attendees will become familiar with the latest research and network for new collaborations. Our objective for this workshop is to amplify the impact of multi-robot navigation research in both academia and industry. The organizers and speakers are from top academic institutes and industry organizations and have a lot of real world experience as well as a strong publishing record in dealing with these aspects. Finally, we are proud to support great diversity in our team including age, gender, ethnicity, and location.[m
