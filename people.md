### Faculty

#### [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/)

|![Joydeep Biswas](assets/images/people/joydeepb.jpg) | Assistant Professor, Computer Science Department, UT Austin; Adjunct Assistant Professor, College of Information and Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst. I received my PhD in Robotics in 2014 from Carnegie Mellon University, and my B.Tech in Engineering Physics in 2008 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My ultimate goal is to have self-sufficient autonomous mobile robots working in human environments, performing tasks accurately and robustly. In support of this goal, I am interested in research in perception, planning, and control applied to autonomous mobile robots.|

#### Corrie Van Sice

| ![Corrie Van Sice](assets/images/people/CVanSice_Avatar_Med.png) | I recently joined the CS staff from Dartmouth College Thayer School of Engineering where I was Senior Research Engineer and manager at the Green 3Dprinting Lab.  Over the last decade, I've developed research and facilities with academic, creative and private company labs, including MakerBot Industries' R&D.  I hold a Masters from NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program, 2011, and BFAs in Interdisciplinary Studio Arts.  I can help with electronics, software, and other common issues in mechatronics, and have special expertise in additive manufacturing and digital fabrication. |

### Postdocs
---

#### [Rohan Chandra](http://rohanchandra30.github.io/)

|![Rohan Chandra](assets/images/people/rohan_chandra.jpg) | Rohan obtained his B.Tech from the Delhi Technological University, New Delhi in 2016 and completed his MS and PhD in 2018 and 2022 from the University of Maryland advised by Dr. Dinesh Manocha. His doctoral thesis focused on autonomous driving in dense, heterogeneous, and unstructured traffic environments, and published his work in top computer vision and robotics conferences (CVPR, ICRA, IROS, etc.). Rohan is a Microsoft Future Leader in Robotics and AI, KAUST Rising Star in AI 2023, UMD’21 Future Faculty Fellow, RSS’22 Pioneer, and he is a recipient of the UMD’20 summer research fellowship. He is currently serving as an Associate Editor for RA-L. Rohan research interests span multi-agent planning and navigation, autonomous driving, and social robot navigation.|

#### [Kia Rahmani](https://kiarahmani.github.io/)

|![Kia Rahmani](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/kiarahmani) | I obtained my PhD in 2022 from Purdue University, where I was supervised by S. Jagannathan and B. Delaware. My main research interests are symbolic analysis and synthesis of neural-powered programs, specifically designed for learning advanced long-term autonomy in mobile robotic fleets. Outsude academia, I am very passionate about martial arts, and specifically, I spend time learning and practicing the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu style of self-defense.  |
