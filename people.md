### Faculty

#### [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/)

|![Joydeep Biswas](assets/images/people/joydeepb.jpg) | Assistant Professor, Computer Science Department, UT Austin; Adjunct Assistant Professor, College of Information and Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst. I received my PhD in Robotics in 2014 from Carnegie Mellon University, and my B.Tech in Engineering Physics in 2008 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My ultimate goal is to have self-sufficient autonomous mobile robots working in human environments, performing tasks accurately and robustly. In support of this goal, I am interested in research in perception, planning, and control applied to autonomous mobile robots.|

#### Corrie Van Sice

|![Corrie Van Sice](assets/images/people/corrie_van_sice.jpg) | I recently joined the CS staff from Dartmouth College Thayer School of Engineering where I was Senior Research Engineer and manager at the Green 3Dprinting Lab.  Over the last decade, I've developed research and facilities with academic, creative and private company labs, including MakerBot Industries' R&D.  I hold a Masters from NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program, 2011, and BFAs in Interdisciplinary Studio Arts.  I can help with electronics, software, and other common issues in mechatronics, and have special expertise in additive manufacturing and digital fabrication. |

### Postdocs
---

#### [Nathan Tsoi](https://nathantsoi.com)

|![Nathan Tsoi](assets/images/people/nathan_tsoi.jpg) | My doctoral work at Yale University introduced new simulation platforms, evaluation frameworks, and data-driven methods for aligning mobile robot behavior with human values. My research vision is to enable the widespread deployment of mobile robots that complete tasks reliably while interacting naturally with people. In pursuit of this vision, I am interested in developing robot learning systems that are sample efficient, robust to real-world uncertainty, and informed by technically grounded methods that predict and optimize for human-centric values.|

#### [Arthur Zhang](https://www.arthurkzhang.com)

|![Arthur Zhang](assets/images/people/arthur_zhang.jpg) | I graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with a B.S.E in Computer Engineering in 2022. There, I worked at the Computational Autonomy and Robotics Laboratory conducting research on invariant state estimation and semantic mapping. I am now in the PhD program at the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin. I am interested broadly in advancing the robustness and scalability of perception algorithms in challenging dynamic conditions. |

#### [Sadanand Modak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadanand-modak-85a9b91a9)

| ![Sadanand Modak](assets/images/people/sadanand_modak.jpg)  | I graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in 2022 with B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering. I worked on projects in diverse areas during my undergrad, which include kinematics and synthesis of robotic manipulators, mutli-robot task allocation systems, computer vision, and development of soft robotic exosuit. I joined the PhD program in Computer Science at UT Austin thereafter in Fall 2022 and have been working as part of AMRL since then. My broad interests lie in long-term autonomy of mobile robots with a focus on advancing current planning/navigation and perception systems to reduce human intervention. |
