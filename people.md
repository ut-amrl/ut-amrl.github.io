### Faculty

#### [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/)

|![Joydeep Biswas](assets/images/people/joydeepb.jpg) | Assistant Professor, Computer Science Department, UT Austin; Adjunct Assistant Professor, College of Information and Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst. I received my PhD in Robotics in 2014 from Carnegie Mellon University, and my B.Tech in Engineering Physics in 2008 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My ultimate goal is to have self-sufficient autonomous mobile robots working in human environments, performing tasks accurately and robustly. In support of this goal, I am interested in research in perception, planning, and control applied to autonomous mobile robots.|

### Research Engineers
---

#### Maxwell Svetlik

|![Maxwell Svetlik](assets/images/people/maxwell_svetlik.jpg) | I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in with a Bachelors degree in 2016. Since then I've been in Robotics Engineering roles in industry with the umbrella goal of getting robots to perform in real world environments. I continue this goal at UT-AMRL and other UT Robotics labs by supporting fundamental research and making developed methods accessible to stakeholders.

### Ph.D. Students
---

#### Jarrett Holtz

|![Jarrett Holtz](assets/images/people/jarrett_holtz.jpg) | I graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Computer Science before moving to the MS/PhD program at UMass Amherst and the Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory. I'm working in robotics because I'm passionate about seeing robotics systems become commonplace as applied to a wide range of problems outside of just research environments. My research interests are in Robotics, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, with a focus on research that makes robots more adaptive to changes in themselves and the environment.|

#### [Sadegh Rabiee](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~srabiee/)

|![Sadegh Rabiee](assets/images/people/sadegh_rabiee.jpg) | I received a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Tehran in 2015 and a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst in 2018. I am now in the PhD program at the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin. I am interested in safe navigation for mobile robots via accurate motion models and perception algorithms that are competence-aware. |
