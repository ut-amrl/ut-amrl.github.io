### Faculty

#### [Joydeep Biswas](https://www.joydeepb.com/)

|![Joydeep Biswas](assets/images/people/joydeepb.jpg) | Assistant Professor, Computer Science Department, UT Austin; Adjunct Assistant Professor, College of Information and Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst. I received my PhD in Robotics in 2014 from Carnegie Mellon University, and my B.Tech in Engineering Physics in 2008 from the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. My ultimate goal is to have self-sufficient autonomous mobile robots working in human environments, performing tasks accurately and robustly. In support of this goal, I am interested in research in perception, planning, and control applied to autonomous mobile robots.|

### Ph.D. Students

#### Jarrett Holtz

|![Jarrett Holtz](assets/images/people/jarrett_holtz.jpg) | I graduated from Vassar College with a degree in Computer Science before moving to the MS/PhD program at UMass Amherst and the Autonomous Mobile Robotics Laboratory. I'm working in robotics because I'm passionate about seeing robotics systems become commonplace as applied to a wide range of problems outside of just research environments. My research interests are in Robotics, Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering, with a focus on research that makes robots more adaptive to changes in themselves and the environment.|

#### [Sadegh Rabiee](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~srabiee/)

|![Sadegh Rabiee](assets/images/people/sadegh_rabiee.jpg) | I received a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at the University of Tehran in 2015 and a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the College of Information and Computer Sciences at UMass Amherst in 2018. I am now in the PhD program at the Department of Computer Science at UT Austin. I am interested in safe navigation for mobile robots via accurate motion models and perception algorithms that are competence-aware. |

#### [Josh Hoffman](https://www.joshbhoffman.com/)

|![Josh Hoffman](assets/images/people/josh_hoffman.jpg)  | I graduated from Northeastern University in 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science, and I worked on deep MARL while there. I am now a first year PhD student at UT Austin where I am studying Computer Science. I joined AMRL during the summer of 2020, and my research interests include reinforcement learning, both single and multi-robot systems, deep learning, and artificial intelligence. |

### Masters Students

#### David Balaban

| ![David Balaban](assets/images/people/david_balaban.jpg) | I graduated from UMass in 2016 with two Bachelor of Science degrees, one in Physics and one in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I am now a graduate student at UMass pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science. My research interests are in Robotics and Optimal Control, Robot Autonomy, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My long-term career goal is to work to make space exploration more accessible through autonomous robotic technologies. |
