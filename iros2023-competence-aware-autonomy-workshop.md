Overview
--------  
***

There is significant interest in deploying autonomous robots in unstructured human environments over extended periods of time, with applications ranging from domestic robots to service robots in the workplace, hospitals, and commercial establishments, last-mile delivery robots, and autonomous vehicles. With such unstructured environments come unexpected challenges, unexpected effects of actions, and new ways to arrive at erroneous perceptual results or planning outcomes. Competence-aware autonomy is a promising approach to address such challenges: to anticipate uncertainty and errors, to discover new failure modes, and to learn to (semi-) autonomously overcome such failures.  Competence-aware autonomy has the ability to know, reason about, and act on the extent of its own capabilities in any situation in the context of different sources of external assistance. This workshop will draw together researchers from both academia and industry interested in sharing promising ideas for competence-aware autonomy, highlighting challenging unsolved problems in the area, and learning more about the real-world impact of this work.

<!-- # Multi-Agent Planning and Navigation in Challenging Environments

## Overview

Multi-robot autonomous navigation is challenging in unstructured environments due to multiple reasons - agents may be non-cooperative, the environment may consist of unpredictable humans, environments may be constrained or consist of unknown objects or terrains. Research is spread across various domains such as perception, prediction, modeling, simulation, and planning in order to make multi-robot planning in such environments safer, efficient, and socially-compliant in the presence of humans. One of the main goals of this workshop is to bring together research communities working at the intersection of multi-agent systems, social robot navigation, and human behavior modeling. Through invited talks, panel discussions, and paper presentations, attendees will become familiar with the latest research and network for new collaborations. Our objective for this workshop is to amplify the impact of multi-robot navigation research in both academia and industry. The organizers and speakers are from top academic institutes and industry organizations and have a lot of real world experience as well as a strong publishing record in dealing with these aspects. Finally, we are proud to support great diversity in our team including age, gender, ethnicity, and location.

## Date and Location

The workshop will be held on 10th or 14th July, 2023 in Daegu, Republic of Korea.
